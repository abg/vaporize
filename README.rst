Vaporize
========

Vaporize is a clean and consistent library for accessing the Rackspace Cloud API_.
 
.. _API: http://docs.rackspace.com/api/

Another One?
------------

There are already a number of good Python options out there for accessing the
Rackspace Cloud API. Unfortunately they have one thing in common: none of them
use the same pattern. This means a lot of wasted time looking things up in
the documentation. The other problem is that there is a library for each group
of sendpoints on the Rackspace cloud API. There's a libarry for CloudServers,
one for CloudFiles, one for CloudDNS and one for CloudLoadBalancers. Which menas
there's a lot of redundant code, requiring four imports and four instantiations 
and it's up to you to smooth over incompatibilities between them.

So Vaporize was born. One library for one API.
